# Workshop Handbook

Welcome to the Learn to Program with JavaScript workshop for NetApp's YWIT 2020.
This handbook will serve as a reference guide and companion for the livestream.
You may use this guide to refer back to concepts that were covered as part of the
livestream. This may be especially useful when you attempt to go out on your own
and make your own creations using the techniques taught as part of this workshop.

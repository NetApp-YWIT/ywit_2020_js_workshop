# Asteroids Examples

The directories on this branch contain example code for finished versions of the
Asteroids game. Each one builds on the last and adds new features to the game.
During the workshop, we will cover at least up through 01_basic. Students are
encouraged to try out what they've learned during the workshop and expand on it.
They may add their own features or use 02_asteroid_breaking or 03_score as hints
on what to try next.
